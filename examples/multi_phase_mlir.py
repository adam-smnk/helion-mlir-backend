"""
Multi-Phase Kernel with MLIR Backend (Direct Execution)

Demonstrates the MLIR backend's `hl.barrier()` support: a kernel with
multiple top-level `hl.tile()` loops separated by an explicit phase boundary,
plus a host-computed tensor ("interop") that isn't one of the kernel's own
parameters.

Unlike the other examples in this directory, a multi-phase / host-tensor-
interop kernel can only be compiled and executed through the direct
`@helion.kernel(backend="mlir")` call path -- NOT through the explicit
`generate_mlir()` + `execute_mlir()` two-call flow, which raises a clear
`UnsupportedOperationError` for this pattern (see docs/MLIR_LIMITATIONS.md,
"Multi-Phase Kernels and Host-Tensor Interop").

Why hl.barrier() is required (not optional, not CPU-specific):
- Helion's frontend rejects a later top-level loop reading a tensor written
  by an earlier one unless hl.barrier() separates them (LoopDependencyError).
- In this backend, each hl.barrier()-separated phase compiles to its own MLIR
  function; a real host-side driver runs between phase calls, threading real
  tensors between phases by their host variable name.

Note on syntax: Helion does not allow any statement (other than
hl.barrier() itself) between two top-level device loops, so a host-computed
interop tensor that a later phase needs must be computed *before* the loops
that use it -- here, `scale` is computed once, before phase 0, and consumed
inside phase 0's loop via `hl.load(scale, [])`.
